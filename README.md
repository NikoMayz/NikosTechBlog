# Nikos Tech Blog

# <h3>Description<h3>

My motivation was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer's posts as well. 
My tech blog simplifies staying updated with the people influencing todays latest technology. 
I have learned how to use the MVC paradigm to structure my application's code.
